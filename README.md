# Welcome

This repository explores if it's possible to parse and review flight data from my [DJI](https://www.dji.com) drones using open source libraries.

## What am I currently flying?

I have two (2) drones that I am flying at the moment - the [DJI Mini 2](https://www.dji.com/mini-2) and the [DJI Air 2S](https://www.dji.com/air-2s).

### DJI Mini 2
