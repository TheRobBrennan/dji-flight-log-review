# Airdata

[Airdata](https://airdata.com) is my preferred platform for uploading and processing DJI Flight Record details from my drones.

Once you have uploaded your flight record for processing, you can see a variety of amazing visualizations and detailed stats of your adventure - as well as download the original file from DJI along with [comma-separated values](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comma-separated_values) (CSV), [GPS Exchange Format](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GPS_Exchange_Format) (GPX), and [Keyhole Markup Language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keyhole_Markup_Language) (KML) files for your flight.

This folder contains examples from the flights that I initially added to the `dji` folder in this project.
